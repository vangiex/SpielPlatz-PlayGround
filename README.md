## Web Based GUI Interface For Cloud VM ( SSH/RDP/VNC )

These days there are many cloud providers intruducing virtual machines ( PAAS ) which allows 
many benifts but tp use those VMs you should know Comand Line for the vm operationg system to
configure it.

This poes a road block, to use these service you either know CLI interface of system or you can
use windows server which allows you access RDP.

This project represent a approch that we can allow web based gui interface to the user using
Apache Guacamole project ( more on : https://guacamole.apache.org/ ). By providing Browser based
gui many other many other things can also be possiable like providing high speed computation to 
rural area where people , school etc can use a simple web enable device can use it.

This project show one of this application by enable GUI interface on VM for rural area 
on Google Cloud Platform.

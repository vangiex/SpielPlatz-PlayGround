Problem :

The virtual envirment for practicing cyber security is indeed not only to the cyber security experts it will also be use full for the students , proffectional &
the instutuion which prapering the next worriers . The virtual cyber lab includes the cretation of labs , sharinng of  expensive hardware and tools . This lab not 
only focus on practical hands on practice but also on theriotcal concepts and diccession  This lab is basced on cloud arch and avalibale over internet using just a
web browser.This lab also provide the GUI & SSH connectivity over web and the lab is complatiable with any device which has a HTML% supported web browser and a 
internet connection. There are available test bed’s offered by various vendors like Cloudshare , Breaking Point by IXIA (Cyber Range), Cybergym by an Israeli company
which offers the labs .We have vision of a virtual lab in which attacking team / induval who carries a cyber attack and the infrastructure for the attacks but the 
controcl is maintain by training expret or the individale who is practicing.There is one more concert that the security of the cyber attack or practice shoud be 
walled inside the cloud practic envirment.

Methods :

We are using existing concepts of Computer Network , Network & server Virtuallition & Web ( Httmp / Https ) to devlope our solution . Our solution constructed using
Java & Vmware . 

benifit : 

1. A secure space to practice cyber attackes
2. A virtual Paletform to learn , share and community
3. Scalable , trackable and all tools at one place
4. Afforadable price and hands on equivments 
5. Accessabe from any where and on any plateform
6. The impact of the cyber attack and practice will be walled under the cloud infersturcture & simulation.
7. Law can be mantian and the practice is ethcial.

cost :

The cost directly depends on the topology you want to practice . For a exapmle we have a topology very basce one and the cost calcuated as

1 vm for Kali (Attacker Pc) { 4Gb ram , I3 2GHZ } =
2 vm for { windows & Linux victim ) { 2Gb ram , I3 2GHZ , Windows Licence } =
Delivery Infarastructure cost = 
Tottal =

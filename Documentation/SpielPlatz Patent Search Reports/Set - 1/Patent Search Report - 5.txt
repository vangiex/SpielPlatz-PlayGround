	19. Limitation of Prior Technology / Art

	20. Specific Problem Solved / Objective of Invention
	
									The invention relates to an experimental cloud platform system for serving computer-and-software-based 
									education in schools of higher education. Based on the computation virtualization technology, the experimental 
									cloud platform system uses a plurality of physical host computers to structure virtual computer trunking experiment
									platforms through the internet and integrates virtual computer trunking system experiment platforms scattered all
									over the school into an experimental cloud platform system; the experimental cloud platform system is equipped with 
									various operating systems for experiments related to computers and softwares and experiment-related softwares and tools 
									as well as a experiment cloud platform data center to store experimental data and experimental results and a terminal for
									users to telnet the experiment cloud platform. With the experiment cloud platform structured, a plurality of people can 
									share the experiment system resources on a computer, thus improving use rate of computer system resources, facilitating
									management on experiment system resources and reducing capitalized cost on computer equipment. The invention is suitable
									for share management on computer computation and software resources in schools of higher education.
	
	21. Brief about Invention
	
									in each university laboratory or experimental center has a computer room and associated computer and software, many of the 
									machines and test computer software programs and other professional experimental course there is a clear difference, namely 
									: on-board computer and software and experimental courses, the laboratory equipment needed for the computer host + OS + 
									related systems software, and other professional (such as machinery) experimental curriculum to include other hardware
									laboratory equipment. Therefore, these experiments must go to the lab courses, to the associated mechanical equipment to
									do the experiment.

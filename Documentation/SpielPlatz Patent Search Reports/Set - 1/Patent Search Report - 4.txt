	20. Specific Problem Solved / Objective of Invention
	
									A virtual computer classroom that allows an instructor to present a lesson to at least one student over a network.
									The network allows the instructor and the student to be in different locations. The classroom broadly comprises a
									target device some aspect of which is the subject of the lesson, a remote access device (RAD) for remotely interacting 
									with the target device, a view server (18) for connecting the RAD to the network, and a presentation server for allowing
									the instructor to present the lesson to the student over the network. The classroom  may also include a remote power 
									controller (RPC) for cycling power to the target device. The student and the instructor preferably access the classroom
									using a JAVA enabled browser.

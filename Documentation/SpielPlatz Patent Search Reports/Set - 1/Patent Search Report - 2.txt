PART 3: TECHNICAL PART OF PATENTED INVENTION
	
	19. Limitation of Prior Technology / Art

	20. Specific Problem Solved / Objective of Invention
														
							A plurality of virtual machines (VMs) is established and maintained by virtualization software on one or more
							physical servers. Desktop management software operates to provide the VMs to remote users as virtualized desktops. 
							The desktop management software includes a connection broker, that allows a remote user to select a type of virtualized 
							desktop and initiate a desktop session. The desktop management software further includes lease management functionality,
							that ensures users are provided access to a particular virtualized desktop for only a fixed period of time. In addition,
							the desktop management software provides an administrative console, which allows an administrator to set various parameters,
							including QoS parameters, and parameters specifying the resources allocated to each user. The desktop management software 
							interacts with lower level software to provide load-balancing functionality, that adjusts the resources provided to each VM 
							based on the needs of the VM. The load-balancing functionality also ensures that QoS parameters are met, and that the parameters
							specifying the maximum resources allocated to each user are not exceeded.
	
	21. Brief about Invention
							
							This invention relates to virtualized computer systems, and, in particular, to a system and method for 
							providing remote desktops on a virtualized computer platform.

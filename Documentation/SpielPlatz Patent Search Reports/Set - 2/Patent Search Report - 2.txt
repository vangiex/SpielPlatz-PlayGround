PART 3: TECHNICAL PART OF PATENTED INVENTION
	
	19. Limitation of Prior Technology / Art : The locally runnable applications through the user interface provided by the server was not possible .

	20. Specific Problem Solved / Objective of Invention : A server-based computing system includes at least one server and at least one client computer, connected to the server through a network. The server includes apparatus for providing the client computer with a user interface. The client computer includes an input device for providing input to an application through the user interface and a display device for presenting output from an application through the user interface. The server includes apparatus for running the application and the client computer includes apparatus for locally running at least one further application. 
	
	21. Brief about Invention :A client computer configured for connection to a server through a network, said server being configured for running an application and said client computer running at least one further application, wherein the client computer comprises:an input device for providing input to the application and the at least one further application; anda display device for presenting output from the application and the at least one further application;wherein said client computer:receives a user interface from the server, the user interface comprising a central screen that enables initiation of the application and the at least one further application;receives a command from the server over the network to launch the at least one further application after initiation of the at least one further application via the user interface;launches the at least one further application in response to receiving the command from the server over the network;generates a local screen, said local screen comprising a window associated with the at least one further application generated by launching the at least onefurther application in response to receiving the command from the server; merges the local screen and the central screen to provide a merged screen to integrate the application and the at least one further application into the user  interface; anddisplays the merged screen on the display device.A computer program stored in a storage memory, the computer program comprising software code portions for running on a client computer, said client computer being configured for connection to a server through a network and running at least one further application, said server being configured for running an application, said client computer comprising an input device for providing input to the application and the at least one further application and a display device for presenting output from the application and the at least one further application,said software code portions, when run on said client computer, performing the steps of:receiving a user interface from the server, the user interface comprising a central screen that enables initiation of the application and the at least one further application;receiving a command from the server over the network to launch the at least one further application after initiation of the at least one further application via the user interface;launching the at least one further application in response to receiving the command from the server over the network,generating a local screen, said local screen comprising a window associated with the at least one further application, said window being generated by launching the at least one further application in response to receiving the command from the server;merging the local screen and the central screen to provide a merged screen integrating the application and the at least one further application into the user interface; and displaying the merged screen on the display device.

	
	22. Key learning Points : Server based computing
	
	23. Summary of Invention : The method according to the invention is characterised in that the user interface to the applications is provided by the server.Thus, a system manager can centrally manage the user interface. Updates, for example, need only be installed once. It is not necessary to use cumbersome methods for remotely installing updates on each client computer or install updates from a CD on each client computer. Users can work on a different client computer, without having to adjust the settings according to their preferences or wait until their settings have been downloaded onto the client computer.In a preferred embodiment, the system according to the invention comprises means for controlling an application running on the server and further applications, running locally, through the user interface.Thus, it is possible to integrate the local and central computing environments, so that a user will not notice any difference between locally and centrally running applications. In the system according to the invention, it is not necessary to switch between separate user interfaces, nor is it necessary to overlay one user interface over another with consequent deterioration of the quality of display and control.In another preferred embodiment, the user interface comprises means for initiating a locally run application. This feature further contributes to the single integrated computer environment. The user interface allows initialisation of every application in the same manner, irrespective of whether it is run locally on the client computer or centrally on the server.
